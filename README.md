Nuries - Shine a light within.

We believe in human creativity in positively transforming our world and that our own personal transformation is the first step towards that. This is why Nuries exists. 

Nuries are a matchstick meditation tool designed to be portable, beautiful, and open. 

Portable: a beautiful box that you keep in your pocket that is beautiful in design and also functions in function to a noPhone: http://www.thenophone.com/ 

Beautiful: Every aspect from the smell of the scented matches, to the image on the box, the tips of the matches and strike area is designed to be beautiful.

Open: This project is on github for a reason. We're interested in sharing something that we find beautiful and helps uplift our creativity through introspection and would love for the idea and message to spread however it does. Your suggestions submitted on github or our facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/nurielights is most welcome! 

Thanks for listening and we hope Nuries help you shine some light where it's dark. 

With lots of love.
