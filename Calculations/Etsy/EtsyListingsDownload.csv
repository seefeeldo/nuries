"Petrichor Oil – Soaked Earth Fragrance - Mitti, Attar - A Geosmin Infused Perfume to Wear, Make Candles, Evoke Memories","I love this scent. It's a natural extract made from only one lake in Kannauj India. A summer storm in a bottle! The monsoons clearing the dust from the streets in india. This scent has many names -- petrichor, mitti, geosmine -- and Kannuaj is the only place in the world that I have found that extracts it naturally.

If you've ever tried CB I Hate Perfume's Soaked Earth accord, this smells vastly different. Less humus and more pavement during a summer shower. If you ask I can provide a sample of CB's accord to contrast. :)

This is rare stuff indeed and we bring it directly to you!
